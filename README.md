CCTV Activity Monitoring Application

## Table of Contents

### Introduction
The CCTV Activity Monitoring Application is designed to help organizations track events and activities captured by security cameras (CCTV). The application utilizes computer vision and a transformer model to analyze camera frames in real-time and identify various human activities, enabling organizations to respond promptly to critical situations.

The primary goal of this project is to detect and raise alerts for urgent tasks, such as fire alerts or incidents involving physical altercations. By automating the monitoring process, the application reduces the need for continuous human supervision, providing a cost-effective and efficient solution for ensuring security and safety.

### Features
Real-time frame analysis using a transformer model.
Detection and categorization of human activities and events.
Generation of alerts for urgent tasks.
Customizable alert thresholds and response mechanisms.
Scalability for use with multiple cameras and locations.
Detailed activity logs and reports.
